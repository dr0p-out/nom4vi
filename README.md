## What and why?

Vietnamese, like any other language in [Sinosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinosphere) had historically used Chinese-derived scripts, and many [Sino-Xenic vocabularies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Xenic_vocabularies) still exist in the language and used even to this day. This means anyone with existing Chinese knowledge or experience with Chinese characters (for example, Japanese) could transfer their knowledge and thus learn the language faster. Or the reverse, it may also be useful for learning Chinese or Japanese with Vietnamese knowledges transferred.

## Frequently asked questions

### How to use the keyboard outside the app?

Not planned yet, since right now, Nôm is only useful for learning, it would take many effort to make a full standard keyboard but likely isn't worth it.

### Where are all the missing features?

Things that can be done by using external tools (like searching, replacing texts) probably won't be added to keep this app simple and minimal
